These spacious and newly refurbished apartments have been uniquely designed with well-proportioned rooms, excellent specifications, thoughtful design and of course the highest standards of construction & workmanship.

The original house was built in c.1767 as a private Georgian Residence and was once the home to The Earl of Clonmel, Chief Justice of the King' s Bench in 1784. In 1916 it was home to British reinforcement troops who landed in Dun Laoghaire for the purpose of defeating the Republican Army at the GPO and during the First World War it was set up as an auxiliary hospital. In 1930 it was opened as a charity for infants known as St Patricks Infants Hospital run by Mary Josephine Cruice.
Neptune House sits between the villages of Blackrock and Monkstown and blends perfectly into the mature surroundings. The houses are contemporary in design and are a visual contrast against the Georgian grandeur of the main house. All houses benefit from the very latest modern efficiencies that A-Rated homes enjoy. The houses employ the latest in modern technologies to achieve their A-rating including a highly efficient heat exchange heating system, state of the art Carlson windows. Internally, each house is fitted to a very high standard with beautiful fitted kitchens and premium integrated appliances, superior tiling, elegant fitted wardrobes and high ceilings at ground floor level.

Situated just 5 miles from Dublin City Centre, Blackrock combines total convenience with a wealth of exceptional amenities. Neptune House is within a short walk of both Blackrock and Monkstown villages hosting an excellent range of shops, churches, seafront walks and an unrivalled range of sports clubs. The DART is very convenient and an abundance of bus routes pass along the Rock Road.

Visual representations, finishes, layouts and/or scales may be approximate or representative of the development rather than exact specifications of the actual unit. The developer reserves the right to make alterations to the design and specification in the overall interest of the development.
